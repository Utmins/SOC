# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution!

## Quick Start
1. Fork and create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-change`.
2. Use Python 3.9+.
3. Keep scripts dependency-free (stdlib only), small and readable.
4. When fixing parsing issues, attach a minimal UTMP/WTMP sample (sanitize if needed).
5. Open a PR with a clear before/after description and terminal screenshots when useful.

## Reporting Bugs
Include:
- OS and Python version
- Exact command run
- A short hexdump or small sample UTMP/WTMP (if possible)
- Expected vs actual output
